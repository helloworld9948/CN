# List of Experiments

1. Implement data link layer framing methods such as character stuffing and bit stuffing.
2. Write a program to compute CRC codes for the polynomials: CRC-12, CRC-16, and CRC-CCIP.
3. Develop a simple data link layer that performs flow control using the sliding window protocol and loss recovery using the Go-Back-N mechanism.
4. Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute the shortest path through a network.
5. Take an example subnet of hosts and obtain a broadcast tree for the subnet.
6. Implement the distance vector routing algorithm to obtain routing tables at each node.
7. Implement data encryption and decryption.
